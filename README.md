# OASIS
This repository contains the OASIS software, designed to automate the processing of GNSS data. The script is a powerful tool for researchers working with large datasets of GNSS observations and ionospheric indices such as DTEC, ROTI, and SIDX. Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the script.
