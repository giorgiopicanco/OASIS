# OASIS: Open-Access System for Ionospheric Studies
This repository contains the OASIS software, designed to automate the processing of GNSS data. The script is a powerful tool for researchers working with large datasets of GNSS observations and ionospheric indices such as DTEC, ROTI, and SIDX.

Key Features

    Batch Processing: Handles the analysis of multiple input files efficiently.
    Automation: Simplifies complex steps in the ionospheric data processing workflow.
    Flexibility: Allows configuration of variables such as input/output directories, GNSS station lists, and time intervals.
    Integration: Compatible with scientific tools for visualization and ionospheric modeling.
